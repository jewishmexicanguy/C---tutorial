In this tutorial we will build some tools that will allow us to do some math.
We will then use this math to simulate behaviours of bosons and fermions.
Afterward we will examine the order in which computation happens and we will optimize our program.

We will explore multi paradigm programming and the important differences bettween how computation takes place.
